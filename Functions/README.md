# Functions

Cheddar aims to fit both object-oriented and functional paradigms. In order to fullfill the functional end of this spectrum, powerful functional features and lambdas are needed and provided. 

A "function" is essentially a block of code which may be given input and can produce output. Think back to your math class:

$$
f(x) = x
$$

Features provided by cheddar include:

 - A wide array of functional operators
 - Various functionized actions
 - Customizable argument handling
 - Anonymous recursion support
 - and more.

This section will cover in-depth function literals, operators, usage, and general practice.
