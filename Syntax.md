# Syntax Inspiration

Cheddar introduces a blend of syntax styles from existing languages. Inspiration is derives from C, Go, and Swift.

An individual "line" or section of code is called a **"statement"**. For example in the following:

```js
var myvar = IO.prompt()
myvar = []; myvar.push(12)
myvar ::= String
print myvar
```

In this program, each is an individual statement:

```
var myvar = IO.prompt()
myvar = []
myvar.push(12)
myvar ::= String
print MyVar
```

Each of these statements can be separated using either a newline or a semicolon `;`.

**Keep in mind**, Cheddar is under development, syntax is subject to change but most probably not drastically.
