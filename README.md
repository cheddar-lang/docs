### The goal of Cheddar

The goal of Cheddar is to be a **powerful**, **extensible** programming language. 

Cheddar puts the entire power of the language in your hands. This lets you develop powerful programs, with the least syntax overhead possible.

We designed the syntax to be **beautiful** and **readable**. You should be able to understand the program at a glance. Lines should line up, and code blocks should be clear.

You get **freedom** when using Cheddar. Cheddar promotes good practice through deterrents, but Cheddar never forces practices upon you. When you code in Cheddar, you can make the choice of how you'd like to design your code. You never need to worry about syntax or functionality.

You **choose** how you want to code in Cheddar. Cheddar is designed for powerful, large-scale applications, but also quick scripting.
